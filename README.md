# Game Playground

This repository is a collection of game prototypes and experiments. The goal is to quickly prototype and test different game mechanics.

## Prototypes

- **[Minecraft Clone](./minecraft-clone/index.html):** A 3D sandbox adventure in a procedurally generated world.

## How to Run

Each prototype is self-contained in its own directory. Simply open the `index.html` file in the root directory to see the main menu, or open the `index.html` file within a specific prototype's directory to run it directly.

The project is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages.
